## 🧠 How It Works

1. User adds medicines to the cart.
2. Backend checks if medicines are from the same pharmacy.
3. If not, the user is prompted to choose:
   - **Quick Delivery** – separate deliveries with an extra fee.
   - **Normal Delivery** – bundled delivery, slower but free.
4. User confirms and proceeds to payment.
5. If payment is successful, the order is placed. If not, it's canceled.
6. In case of emergency:
   - 🛑 **Uncancellable Emergency Cab** – The user can instantly book a dedicated emergency cab to the nearest hospital. Once booked, it cannot be canceled to ensure urgency is prioritized.
   - 🚑 **One-Tap Ambulance** – The user can book an ambulance to their live location with a single tap, enabled by GPS and nearby partner integration.
